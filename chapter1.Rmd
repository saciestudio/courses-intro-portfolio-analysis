## Getting a grasp of the basics

Welcome to Introduction to Portfolio Analysis! In the last video you were given a brief overview of some of the key concepts in portfolio analysis. The goal of every stock investor is to make profits while reducing the amount of risk involved. Investors create strategies to reduce these risks.

Which of the following is true about investment:

*** =instructions
- Portfolios are that consist of very different assets are poorly diversified.
- Portfolios that consist of very different assets are diversified.
- Investors reduce risk by investing in a fewer number of assets.
- Portfolio strategies cannot be tested.

## Get a feel for the data

The choice of investment matters even when the underlying risky assets are similar. As a first example, let us consider the stock price of the Coca Cola Company and the PepsiCo company from January 2003,  until today.  

The time series plot shows you the value evolution of one dollar invested in each company. As an exercise, plot the time series showing the relative value of an investment in the Coca Cola company, compared to the value of an investment in PepsiCo. To do this exercise, you can us the corresponding price series, available as the variables `ko` and `pep` in your workspace. 

*** =instructions
- Define `ko_pep` as the ratio expressing the value of the share price of the Coca Cola company in terms
of the share price of PepsiCo
- Use [`plot.zoo()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/zoo/functions/plot.zoo) to visualize the variation in this ratio over time. 
- Use `abline` to include a horizontal line at `h=1`.
- Note that when the value of the ratio increases, `ko` outperforms `pep` and vice versa
- Note that when the value of the ratio is larger than 1, the performance of `ko` since January 2003 is higher than that of `pep`. Therefore, as a reference line, use `abline` to include a horizontal line at `h=1`.


*** =hint
[`plot.zoo()`](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/zoo/functions/plot.zoo) only needs one argument, ko_pep.

## A first portfolio: buy-and-hold versus daily rebalancing

The choice of investment matters, even when the underlying risky assets are similar. As a second example, you will now consider the stock price of Apple and Microsoft from January 2006 until today. The time series plot shows you the value evolution of one dollar invested in each of them. 

It is time to consider our first portfolio. The portfolio approach that you will use to invest is to invest half of the budget in Apple, and the other half of your budget in Microsoft. 
Over time, the portfolio weights will change. You will have two choices as an investor. The first choice is to be **passive and not trade any further**. This is called a *buy and hold* strategy. The second choice is to buy and trade at the close of each day that results in a **rebalance** of the portfolio such that your portfolio is equally invested in shares of Microsoft and Apple. This is a *rebalanced portfolio*. 

Which of the following statements is false?

*** =instructions
- By investing in a portfolio of risky assets, the portfolio payoff will be in between the minimum and maximum of the payoff of the underlying risky assets.
- By investing in a portfolio of risky assets, the risk of the portfolio payoff will be less than the maximum risk of the underlying risky assets.
- An investor needs to have a lot of capital to be able to invest in a portfolio of many assets. 
- Because the prices of Microsoft and Apple have evolved differently, the investor who spent initially half of his wealth on Microsoft and Apple ends up with a portfolio that is no longer equally invested.

## The weights of a market capitalization weighted portfolio

In a market capitalization weighted portfolio, the weights are given by the individual assets' market capitalizations divided by the sum of the market capitalizations of all assets. A typical example is the S&P 500 invested in the 500 largest companies listed on the US stock exchanges (NYSE, Nasdaq).  Note that dividing by the total value of the characteristic across all assets guarantees that the portfolio weights sum up to unity. 

As an exercise, inspect the distribution of market capitalization based weights when the portfolio is invested in 10 stocks. For this exercise use market capitalizations of 5, 8, 9, 20, 25, 100, 100, 500, 700 and 2000 million USD. 

*** =instructions
- Define the vector `marketcaps` holding the market capitalization
- Calculate the weights of `marketcaps` and assign them to `weights`
- Print a summary of `weights`

## Calculation of portfolio returns

For your first exercise you will prove that a portoflio return can be computed as the weigthed average of the portfolio component returns.

Remember that a **portfolio return** is calculated by taking the sum of simple returns multiplied by the portfolio weights.

You will use three assets for this example.

Assume that you invested in three assets. Their intial values are 1000 USD, 5000 USD, 2000 USD respectively. Over time, the values change to 1100 USD, 4500 USD, and 3000 USD.

*** =instructions
- Create a vector of the initial asset values `in_values`. 
- Create a vector of the final values, `fin_values`. 
- Create a vector of the initial weights, `weights`.
- Use the simple return definition to compute the vector of returns on the three component assets. Assign return values to `returns`.
- Assign the portfolio returns to `preturns`
- Verify that the weighted average portfolio return equals the percentage change in the total portfolio value using [all.equal()](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/all.equal). Run the provided code.

*** =hint
Use the portfolio return formula to compute the simple portfolio return!

# Verify that it matches with the percentage change in the portfolio value

## From simple to gross and multi-period returns   

The simple return $R$ expresses the percentage change in value of an investment. The corresponding so-called "gross" return is defined as the future value of $1 invested in the asset for one period, and is thus equal to *$1+R$*.

The gross returns over two periods is obtained similarly. Let *$R_1$* be the return in the first period and *$R_2$* the return in the second period. Then the end-value of a 1 USD investment is $(1 + R_1)*(1 + R_2)$. 

The corresponding simple return over those two periods is: $(1+R_1)*(1+R_2)-1$ .

Suppose that you have an investment horizon of two periods. In the first period you make a 10% return. But in the second period you take a loss of 5%. 

Use the R console to compute the end value, and the simple return of an initial investment of a 1000 USD investment.

Which of the three following answers do you obtain?

*** =instructions
- End-value = 1155
- End-value = 1045
- End-value = 1050

*** =hint
If $R_1$ is the return in the first period and $R_2$ is the return in the second period, then the end-value of a $1 investment is $(1+R_1)*(1+R_2)$ .

## The asymmetric impact of gains and losses  

It is important to be aware of the fact that a positive and negative return of the same magnitude do not compensate each other in terms of terminal wealth. Mathematically, this can be seen from the identity $(1+x)*(1-x)=1-x^2$, which is less than one. A 50% loss is thus not compensated by a 50% gain.  After a loss of 50%, what is the return needed to be at par again? Verify your answer in the R console.

## The time series of asset returns  

Calculating the returns for one period is pretty forward to do in R. When the returns need to be calculated for different dates the functions [Return.calculate](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/functions/Return.calculate) and [Return.portfolio](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/functions/Return.portfolio), in the R package [PerformanceAnalytics](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/performanceanalytics/functions/performanceanalytics-package) are extremely helpful. They require the input data to be of the [xts-time series class](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/xts/functions/xts-package). You will explore the functionality of the [PerformanceAnalytics](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/performanceanalytics/functions/performanceanalytics-package) package in this exercise. 

You have a portfolio invested in Apple stock, and Microsoft stock. The prices for each stock are available in the variables `aapl` and `msft` in your workspace.

*** =instructions
- Load the packages `xts` and `PerformanceAnalytics` in your R session.
- Use the function [merge](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/xts/functions/merge) to bind the variables `aapl` and `msft`, call this `prices`.
- Print the first and last six row of `prices` using `head` and `tail`.
- Use the function [Return.calculate](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/functions/Return.calculate) with as only argument `prices` to compute for each date the return as the percentage change in the price compared to the previous date, call this `returns`.
- Print the first six rows of `returns`.
- Remove the first row of `returns`

## The time series of portfolio returns

Let us now continue the exercise by computing the portfolio returns under different choices of rebalancing the portfolio weights.

The first choice is the buy-and-hold. 

The second choice is to rebalance at a monthly frequency. The target weights are assumed to be the same for each rebalancing date. We call this the constant mix portfolio allocation strategy.   


*** =instructions
- Define `weights` as the vector of equal weights for a portfolio fully invested in two assets. 
- Use the function [Return.portfolio](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/functions/Return.portfolio) with as first argument `returns` and as second argument `weights` to compute for each date the return of the buy-and-hold portfolio for which the initial weights are set to `weights`.
- Do the same but for the monthly rebalanced portfolio.
- Make a time series plot of the portfolio returns. 
- Repeat the above, but now set the arguments `verbose=TRUE`. It will now return an object holding various arguments. Investigate this using `names()`
- Compare the end-of period weights

## From daily to monthly portfolio returns

We have now plotted the daily return series. In practice, portfolio managers rarely communicate their daily returns, but focus on the total (compound) performance over a longer period, such as a month or a year. 

The next chapter is devoted to performance evaluation.  But let us  touch intuition now by focussing on the cumulative return evoluation in September 2008. This was an exceptional month for investors, with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brother on September 15 as an important turning point.  

*** =instructions
- Print the daily returns in September 2008 using `preturns["2008-09"]`.
- In order to see how a one dollar investment evolved over that month, print `cumprod(1+preturns["2008-09"])`. Its $k$-th observation  corresponds to the chain $(1+R_1)*(1+R_2)*...*(1+R_K),$ with $R_i$ the $i$-th return of that month
- Compute the return over this month as the simple percentage change between the final and initial value of this one-dollar investment.
- Verify that you obtain the same number as when using the function `Return.cumulative(preturns["2008-09"])]`.

## Sneak preview of the portfolio fin and fun ahead

The *fin*ancial theory of portfolio analysis and the *fun* of applying portfolio management in R, that's what this course is all about.

It's about the landmark contributions of Nobel prize winners like Daniel Kahneman, Harry Markowitz, William Sharpe, James Tobin and Robert Engle. 

To maky you hungry for more, look at the nice output tables and plots printed in the workspace. This is what we will be doing in the next chapter, leveragin mainly the functionality in the package [PerformanceAnalytics](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/functions/PerformanceAnalytics-package). 

Which of the following functions is not in the package [PerformanceAnalytics](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/functions/PerformanceAnalytics-package). 


*** =instructions
- According to Daniel Kahneman, in decision involving risk, most people are anything but rational. They fail to have the broad view and are carried away by individual gains and losses. You win a few, you lose a few. It's the bottom line that matters. This is to be computed using: [Return.annualized](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/functions/Return.annualized). 
- [SharpeRatio](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/PerformanceAnalytics/functions/SharpeRatio).  Sharpe and Tobin. 
- [optim.portfolio](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tseries/functions/optim.portfolio]). Harry Markowitz of the portfolio returns compared to the returns of a benchmark strategy, the higher the risk that the returns on the portfolio strategy will deviate from the benchmark returns. 
- Rolling standard deviations. Engle
